    title: "Frequently asked questions"
    entry1:
      q: "Is there a limit as to how many pieces I can convert to LiveScores?"
      a: "Newzik Pro and Newzik Education subscribers can convert up to 50 pages per month. You can check how many pages you have left in the LiveScore Dashboard. We plan to introduce ways to extend this limit in the future."
    entry2:
      q: "How long does it take to convert sheet music to LiveScore?"
      a: "Converting PDF sheet music to LiveScores requires powerful Optical Music Recognition (OMR) algorithms and deep learning processes in order to get the best result possible. Depending on the number of pages and the complexity of your parts, the conversion process can take some time (up to a couple minutes per page). This process will become increasingly faster in the future."
    entry3:
      q: "What musical elements can be converted?"
      a: "Most common musical elements can be converted thanks to Maestria's deep learning technology. We are continuously working on making more and more musical elements compatible, and you can find the updated list of compatible musical elements"

    entry4:
      q: "I cannot convert my sheet music to LiveScore. Why?"
      a1: "If the number of pages of the part you are trying to convert exceeds the amount of LiveScore credits you own for the current month (maximum 50 pages per month), you will not be able to convert your sheet music to LiveScore."
      a2: "It is not possible to convert licensed sheet music to LiveScores."
      a3: "Please note that only Newzik subscribers (Pro, Education or Ensemble users) have access to this feature."
    entry5:
      q: "Can I convert to LiveScore from the Newzik app?"
      a: "Absolutely. You can now convert your regular scores to LiveScores directly from the app."
    entry6:
      q: "The conversion was not accurate, how can I fix it?"
      a1: "First of all, rate the conversion to help us improve the technology. After a conversion in Newzik Web, you can rate it from 1 to 5 stars and provide written feedback. You can also send an email to contact@newzik.com"
      a2: "You can also export the MusicXML version of your score to correct it in your notation software. You can do the same with the MIDI file and rework it in your DAW."
